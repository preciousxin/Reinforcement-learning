# Reinforcement-learning
Some practice codes for reinforcement learning.
Including algorithms: 
1 Deep Q-network (DQN)
2 Double DQN (DDQN)
3 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
4 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
5 Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)

(Currently, only PPO algorithm can run with selective modes: activation function, weight initialization, optimizer, learning rate.)
